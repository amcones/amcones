### Hi there 👋

This is amcones and my friends usually call me uli([juːli]). I am an undergrad student studying in China, Hunan.

I'm a competition programmer, and I'm currently working on algorithmic, DS, and other techniques such as Go, Python, C#.

I started programming when I was fifteen, and I love it❤️!!! I have taken part in unity projects and WPF projects, but in fact, I am a beginner at open-source programming.

I'm looking forward to taking part in some famous open-source projects.
